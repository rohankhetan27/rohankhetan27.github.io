  <h1>Rohan Khetan's Goals For America</h1>
  <h2>Rohan wishes to finish the job that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson started</h2>
  <h2>Here are his 3 main policies.</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>#1: Policies on economic growth.</li>
    <p>I believe in minimizing YOUR taxes, so you can use your money for yourself. However, instead of taxes, we will get money by taxing exports, and requiring a fee for any travellers to America. We also want to improve our agriculture, so we can sell more crops to countries like France, Britain, and the Netherlands.</p>
    <li>#2: Rohan’s Policy on Power</li>
    <p>Because we fought to win our freedom from Britain's strong and controlling central government, we will make sure the power is spread evenly among the state governments. Each state will have the right to make its own decisions, and laws will be decided by a vote from the governor of that state. This way, no single group or leader will have too much control, keeping the freedom we worked so hard to get.</p>
    <li>#3: Rohan’s Foreign Policy</li>
    <p>Just like George Washington, I believe in maintaining neutral relationships with international countries, so we can engage in trade without controversy. However, since France has been a big supporter in us, I will continue to support France through their hardships, just to repay the favor. To maintain friendly relationships with other countries, I will organize a golf party so we can get along with fellow leaders.</p>

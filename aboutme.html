  <h1>ðŸ¥‡About the Best CandidateðŸ¥‡</h1>
  <p>Born in Boston in 1750, Rohan Khetan was educated at Harvard College where he graduated in 1771 and showed particular aptitude in mathematics and political philosophy. In America's revolutionary era he joined the Sons of Liberty, helped draft the Declaration of Independence, and served as a mathematics officer for George Washington's army at Valley Forge.
  </p>
  <p>Rohan was a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 and prepared parts of the U.S. Constitution. In 1791, he founded the Massachusetts Institute of Practical Sciences (MIPS) that fostered engineering and navigation. He advised on the Louisiana Purchase (1803) and supported the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804â€“1806 with tools and geographic expertise.
  </p>
  <p>Rohan Khetan was an avid Democratic-Republican who looked up to Thomas Jefferson's vision of liberty. He supported the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, advising on stability, and defended the Embargo Act of 1807 as a necessary evil despite the economic hardships it brought. His steadfast devotion to the ideas of Jefferson defined his role in shaping early America.
  </p>
<h2>Rohan Khetan: the leader we need, the visionary we deserve, and the greatest man alive to guide us into a new era.</h2>
